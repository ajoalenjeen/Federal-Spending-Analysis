Federal contract spending steadily increased from FY2020 to FY2024, rising from $198.6B to $252.8B. The Department of Veterans Affairs, Department of Energy, and Department of Health & Human Services accounted for the majority of the spending, reflecting national priorities in healthcare, energy infrastructure, and research. Heatmap analysis shows clear year-over-year increases in VA and DOE spending, while HHS spending was elevated during COVID-19 years before stabilizing. Overall, spending trends indicate growing investment in public health, national security, and technology modernization.


### Which contractors receive the most federal funding?

Federal contract spending is highly competitive, as shown by a very low HHI (0.0081).
However, a few vendors consistently dominate due to the government’s reliance on:

* Healthcare services & claims management (Optum, TriWest)

* Pharmaceutical distribution (McKesson)

* National laboratories & defense R&D (Sandia, Triad National Security)

Optum Public Sector Solutions emerges as the largest contractor starting FY2021, reflecting growth in federal health analytics, Medicare/Medicaid data systems, and VA healthcare management.

Across FY2020-FY2024, health-related vendors receive the largest contract obligations, showing that public health, veterans’ services, and pandemic recovery remain top federal priorities.


### What drives spending concentration in certain states or sectors?

The choropleth map shows that states such as Virginia, Texas, California, Maryland, and Florida capture a disproportionate share of federal contract spending.

1. Virginia (VA) leads even without DoD data

Virginia remains the highest-spending state because:

It hosts major federal contracting hubs in Northern Virginia (Arlington, Fairfax, Reston, Chantilly).

Home to large contractors serving civilian agencies
(e.g., Booz Allen, SAIC, Leidos, GDIT, Accenture Federal).

Many contracts are for IT modernization, cybersecurity, logistics, and healthcare support.

✔ Conclusion: Spending is concentrated where federal contractors are physically located.

2. Texas (TX) and California (CA) also show significant spending

These states contain:

Major federal hospitals (VA medical centers)

Large research laboratories (DOE & NIH grantees)

Border security operations (DHS)

Strong biotechnology & technology ecosystems

✔ Conclusion: States with major infrastructure, medical facilities, or tech ecosystems naturally receive higher obligations.

3. Rural or low-population states receive less

States without:

Large federal labs

Advanced tech industries

The sector bar chart highlights the Top 10 NAICS industries receiving the most federal funds.

The biggest sectors include:

Facilities Support Services

Health and Medical Insurance Carriers

Computer Systems Design Services

Other Computer-Related Services

Pharmaceutical & Medical Manufacturing

Research & Development Services

1. Healthcare dominates due to VA + HHS

The federal government is the largest healthcare purchaser in the U.S., so spending is concentrated in:

Medical supplies & pharmaceuticals

Diagnostics & laboratory services

Health insurance processing

Hospital facility operations

✔ Conclusion: Healthcare spending is structurally high because VA and HHS rely heavily on private contractors.

2. IT Services rank among the top sectors

Civilian agencies (Treasury, Commerce, HUD, Education, DHS, State) all require:

Cybersecurity

Cloud migration

Data center operations

Software development

Network modernization

✔ Conclusion: Federal IT modernization mandates drive massive spending in IT and computer-related services.

3. Facility maintenance & construction are major recurring costs

All federal agencies require:

Building operations

Laboratory upkeep

Real estate services

Infrastructure support

✔ Conclusion: Facilities support is a large cost center across all agencies.

Major healthcare networks

Federal logistics hubs

tend to receive much smaller contract amounts.
