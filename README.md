Federal contract spending steadily increased from FY2020 to FY2024, rising from $198.6B to $252.8B. The Department of Veterans Affairs, Department of Energy, and Department of Health & Human Services accounted for the majority of the spending, reflecting national priorities in healthcare, energy infrastructure, and research. Heatmap analysis shows clear year-over-year increases in VA and DOE spending, while HHS spending was elevated during COVID-19 years before stabilizing. Overall, spending trends indicate growing investment in public health, national security, and technology modernization.


### Which contractors receive the most federal funding?



Federal contract spending is highly competitive, as shown by a very low HHI (0.0081).
However, a few vendors consistently dominate due to the government’s reliance on:

* Healthcare services & claims management (Optum, TriWest)

* Pharmaceutical distribution (McKesson)

* National laboratories & defense R&D (Sandia, Triad National Security)

Optum Public Sector Solutions emerges as the largest contractor starting FY2021, reflecting growth in federal health analytics, Medicare/Medicaid data systems, and VA healthcare management.

Across FY2020-FY2024, health-related vendors receive the largest contract obligations, showing that public health, veterans’ services, and pandemic recovery remain top federal priorities.
